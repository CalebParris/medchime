## Installation

To install, please run the following code in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

You will need to have Expo CLI installed to your computer. To do this, you can follow the documentation found at [https://docs.expo.io/](https://docs.expo.io/). You will also need to have either an iPhone or Android phone with the expo client app installed to fully use all of the functionality of this app. Information on this can be found in the documentation link previously provided.

### **_NOTE: If you are using a Windows OS, then you will not be able to test iPhone functionality. There are ways around this, however this readme does not cover such information. MAC OS users will have no issues testing both iPhone and Android devices_**

## Usage

To use this app, run the following command in the terminal:

```
expo start
```

This will start the expo client in your web browser and then you must either connect your phone by scanning the QR Code or by using the appropriate command for your device.
